# higlass-server

The HiGlass Server supports the [HiGlass Client](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/higlass)
by providing APIs for accessing and uploading tile files generated by
[Clodius](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/clodius).

## Easy Docker install

The easiest way to run HiGlass is with Docker. More information is available at
[higlass-docker](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/higlass-docker#readme).

## Installation from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hms-dbmi/higlass-server.git
cd higlass-server/
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver localhost:8000
```

(Note that this server does not provide any HTML,
so visiting http://localhost:8000/ only produces a 404.)

## API Demo

A username and password are required for most API calls. For now, the best way to do this is:
```
echo "import django.contrib.auth; django.contrib.auth.models.User.objects.create_user('username', password='password')" \
     | python manage.py shell
```

```
COOLER=dixon2012-h1hesc-hindiii-allreps-filtered.1000kb.multires.cool
HITILE=wgEncodeCaltechRnaSeqHuvecR1x75dTh1014IlnaPlusSignalRep2.hitile

wget -P /tmp https://s3.amazonaws.com/pkerp/public/$COOLER
wget -P /tmp https://s3.amazonaws.com/pkerp/public/$HITILE

curl -F "datafile=@/tmp/$COOLER" -F "filetype=cooler" -F "datatype=matrix" -F "uid=cooler-demo" \
     -u username:password -F "coordSystem=hg19" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tilesets/
curl -F "datafile=@/tmp/$HITILE" -F "filetype=hitile" -F "datatype=vector" -F "uid=hitile-demo" \
     -u username:password -F "coordSystem=hg19" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tilesets/
```

The `uid` parameter is optional, and if it were missing, one would be generated.
Each POST returns JSON describing the new object.

We can now use the API to get information about a tileset:
```
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tileset_info/?d=hitile-demo
```

Or to get a tile:
```
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tiles/?d=hitile-demo.0.0.0
```

## Preparing files for ingest

Genomics data needs to be aggregated across a range of scales before it can be used with HiGlass.

### Cooler files

**TODO**: Is this still accurate?

[Cooler](https://github.com/mirnylab/cooler) files store Hi-C data. They need to be decorated with aggregated
data at multiple resolutions in order to work with `higlass-server`. This is easily accomplished by simply 
installing the `cooler` python package and running the `recursive_agg_onefile.py` script. For now this has 
to come from a clone of the official cooler repository, but this will hopefully be merged into the main branch shortly.

```

git clone -b develop https://github.com/pkerpedjiev/cooler.git
cd cooler
python setup.py install

recursive_agg_onefile.py file.cooler --out output.cooler
```

### BigWig files

BigWig files can be aggregated with the [Clodius](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/clodius#bigwig-files).

### **TODO**: Any other types?

## Development

After you've done an installation from source you're ready to go.
You can use `./test.sh` to run the same tests that Travis will run.

### Upgrades

```
bumpversion patch
```
